## TASK 1
### Q1. What is the server's OS version? 
<img width="857" height="276" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8136155e-ea18-4f5d-8481-fa8987b8cc23" />

## TASK 2
### Q1. What's the most interesting file you found in giorgio's home directory?
<img width="794" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bcdb954-cf65-4d42-afd4-f606b7c8b06e" />

Commands
1. `cd home`
2. `cd giorgio`
3. `ls`
4. `ls -la` 

### Q2. In every investigation, it's important to keep a dirty wordlist to keep track of all your findings, no matter how small. It's also a way to prevent going back in circles and starting from scratch again. As such, now's a good time to create one and put the previous answer as an entry so we can go back to it later.
### Another file that can be found in every user's home directory is the .bashrc file. Can you check if you can find something interesting in giorgio's .bashrc?
TIP: `Hey,
This is the hint you’re looking for: alias is a command that allows a string to be interpreted using a shorter, usually easier-to-remember "alias" for the string. Maybe there's a suspicious usage of alias somewhere?
Let me know if you want any help.`

Command
1. `cat .bashrc | grep "alias"`

### Q3. It seems we've covered the usual bases in giorgio's home directory, so it's time to check the scheduled tasks that he owns.
### Did you find anything interesting about scheduled tasks?

## TASK 3
### Q1. This section is a bonus discussion on the importance of a dirty wordlist. Accept the extra point and happy hunting!
### What is the flag?

## TASK 4
### Q1. A few moments after logging on to the root account, you find an error message in your terminal.
### What does it say?
<img width="547" height="61" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/423b9d00-f276-4b2e-bdbb-74280f63f5b0" />

After selecting 'Root', you just have to wait for the error message.

### Q2. After moving forward with the error message, a suspicious command appears in the terminal as part of the error message.
### What command was displayed?
<img width="685" height="106" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8426187a-6f97-4297-9c8a-582dde5e6cd8" />

After answering Q1, you only need to press Enter to reveal the command. 

### Q3. You might wonder, "how did that happen? I didn't even do anything? I just logged as root, and it happened."
### Can you find out how the suspicious command has been implemented?
<img width="1006" height="80" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c4a928c-cce6-41dd-8b9a-fca3be52015c" />

We know that the message when we sign in as root is "172.10.6.9". We have to search for that IP address in /home/giorgio using the command 'grep -R'
Command
1. `grep -R "172.10.6.9"`

--- 
## TASK 5
### Q1. What is the last persistence mechanism?
<img width="852" height="90" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2507452f-5f9c-4303-8770-3aadceb8c210" />

This command lists only real users on the system by filtering /etc/passwd entries with a UID ≥ 1000 (typically human accounts) and printing their usernames. It helps exclude system accounts and identify normal users.

Command
1. ` awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 {print $1}' /etc/passwd`

## TASK 6
### Q1. What is the nugget?
<img width="1617" height="306" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a79a3990-0fba-4dbf-a16a-cc34d9f4a4fd" />

Thanks for the /etc/passwd file. We know that nobody has 'nonexistent/'. We will enter 'nobody' and go to '/nonexistent'. After this, we will use 'ls -la' to view 'youfoundme' and 'cat' this file.

Commands
1. `sudo su nobody`
2. `cd ..`
3. `cd ..`
4. `ls`
5. `cd nonexistent/`
6. `ls`
7. `ls -la`
8. `cat .youfoundme`
