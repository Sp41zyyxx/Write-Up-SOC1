## Task 2 Opcodes and Operands
### Q1. What are the hex codes that denote the assembly operations called?
Opcodes

### Q2. Which type of operand is denoted by square brackets?
memory operand

---

## Task 3 General Instructions
### Q1. In mov eax, ebx, which register is the destination operand?
eax

### Q2. What instruction performs no action?
nop

---

## Task 4 Flags
### Q1. Which flag will be set if the result of the operation is zero? (Answer in abbreviation)
ZF

### Q2. Which flag will be set if the result of the operation is negative? (Answer in abbreviation)
SF

---
 
## Task 5 Arithmetic and Logical Instructions
### Q1. In a subtraction operation, which flag is set if the destination is smaller than the subtracted value?
Carry Flag

### Q2. Which instruction is used to increase the value of a register
inc

### Q3. Do the following instructions have the same result? (yea/nay)
 `xor eax, eax`  `mov eax, 0`

they produce the same final value (EAX = 0), but they are not identical.

`xor eax, eax` → sets EAX to 0 and modifies CPU flags.

`mov eax, 0` → sets EAX to 0 without changing flags.

---

## Task 6 Conditionals and Branching
### Q1. Which flag is set as a result of the test instruction being zero?
Zero Flag

### Q2. Which of the below operations uses subtraction to test two values? 1 or 2?
`cmp eax, ebx` `test eax, ebx`

1

### Q3. Which flag is used to identify whether a jump will be taken or not after a jz or jnz instruction? 
Zero Flag

---

## Task 7 Stack and Function calls
### Q1. Which instruction is used for performing a function call?
call

### Q2.Which instruction is used to push all registers to the stack?
Push

---

0x00000040

### Q2. What error is displayed after running the 6th instruction from the MOV instruction section?
Memory to memory data movement is not allowed.

### Q3. Run the instructions from the stack section. What is the value of eax after the 9th instruction? (in hex)

### Q5. Run the instructions from the stack section. After POP ecx, what is the value left at the top of the stack? (in hex)
0x00000010

### Q6. Run the cmp and test instructions. Which flags are triggered after the 3rd instruction?
(Note: Use these abbreviations in alphabetical order with no spaces: CF,PF,SF,ZF)


PF,ZF

### Q7. Run the test and the cmp instructions. Which flags are triggered after the 11th instruction?
(Note: Use these abbreviations in alphabetical order with no spaces: CF,PF,SF,ZF)


CF,SF

0x0000004B

### Q9. Run the instructions from the lea section. What is the final value found in the ECX register? (in hex)
0x00000045
