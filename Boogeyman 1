Uncover the secrets of the new emerging threat, the Boogeyman.

Artefacts

For the investigation proper, you will be provided with the following artefacts:

Copy of the phishing email (dump.eml)
Powershell Logs from Julianne's workstation (powershell.json)
Packet capture from the same (capture.pcapng)

TASK 2
The Boogeyman is here!
we know that the compromise started with a phishing email. Let's start with analysing the dump.eml file located in the artefacts directory.

Q1.What is the email address used to send the phishing email?
The sender’s email address is visible in the From header.

Q2.What is the email address of the victim?
The victim’s email address is visible in the email headers, specifically in the To: field.

Q3.What is the name of the third-party mail relay service used by the attacker based on the DKIM-Signature and List-Unsubscribe headers?
By inspecting the DKIM-Signature and List-Unsubscribe headers in the email, we can determine the third-party mail relay service used by the attacker.
Tip: You can use cat and grep to filter these headers.

Q4.What is the name of the file inside the encrypted attachment?
To identify the file name, the dump.eml file must be saved locally. The encrypted attachment reveals the file name once extracted.

Q5.What is the password of the encrypted attachment?
The password of the encrypted attachment is visible between the <strong> tags in the email body. The full body can be viewed using cat dump.eml.

Q6.Based on the result of the lnkparse tool, what is the encoded payload found in the Command Line Arguments field?
After extracting Invoice.zip, the encoded payload can be identified by analyzing the .lnk file with lnkparse, specifically in the Command Line Arguments field.


TASK 3

Q1.What are the domains used by the attacker for file hosting and C2? Provide the domains in alphabetical order. (e.g. a.domain.com,b.domain.com)
